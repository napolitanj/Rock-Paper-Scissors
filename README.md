The Odin Project Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Goal:

Create a simple rock vs. paper vs. scissors game to build understanding of javascript basics.

----------
Version 4.0
----------

The game is no longer played in console, and instead includes a working user interface that takes allows the player to select their input with the press of a button. Additionally, the game announces who wins each round, and keeps track of score. At 5 points, the game decides a winner, although the player may continue to play.

----------
Version 3.0
----------

The game now prompts the user for input.

----------
Version 2.0
----------

The game has been updated to play until either the computer or player wins after either wins 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors. In the unlikely event that there are 100 draws, the game ends, prompting the player that the program did so to prevent a possible crash from too many computations.

----------
Version 1.0
----------

Created a game that operates in the command line. The player must enter their selection in the file. The game will correct and capitalization or "case" discrepencies, but it will not correct the player if they enter an incorrect option.
